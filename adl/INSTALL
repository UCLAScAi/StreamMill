AXL - Aggregate eXtension Language
=====================================

Assume the AXL package is untared in the AXL/ directory and you have
installed the Berkeley DB system from http://www.sleepycat.com

1. configure

   ./configure 

   or

   ./configure --enable-debug

   create a symbolic link "BerkeleyDB" that points to the installed
BerkeleyDB package (preferably version 3.1.17) under the AXL/ diretory

2.
    make

    make install

    this will install AXL into /usr/local
