<h1 align=center>Transactions and non-Berkeley DB applications</h1>
<p>It is possible to use the Locking, Logging and Transaction subsystems
of Berkeley DB to provide transaction semantics on objects other than those
described by the Berkeley DB access methods.  In these cases, the application
will need more explicit customization of the subsystems, as well as the
development of appropriate data-structure-specific recovery functions.
<p>For example, consider an application that provides transaction semantics
on data stored in plain UNIX files accessed using the POSIX read and write
system calls.  The operations for which transaction protection is desired
are bracketed by calls to <a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_begin</a> and <a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">DB_TXN-&gt;commit</a>.
<p>Before data is accessed, the application must make a call to the lock
manager, <a href="../../api_c/lock_get.html">DB_ENV-&gt;lock_get</a>, for a lock of the appropriate type (for
example, read) on the object being locked.  The object might be a page
in the file, a byte, a range of bytes, or some key.  It is up to the
application to ensure that appropriate locks are acquired.  Before a
write is performed, the application should acquire a write lock on the
object by making an appropriate call to the lock manager,
<a href="../../api_c/lock_get.html">DB_ENV-&gt;lock_get</a>.  Then, the application should make a call to the log
manager, <a href="../../api_c/log_put.html">DB_ENV-&gt;log_put</a>, to record enough information to redo the
operation in case of failure after commit and to undo the operation in
case of abort.
<p>When designing applications that will use the log subsystem, it is
important to remember that the application is responsible for providing
any necessary structure to the log record.  For example, the application
must understand what part of the log record is an operation code, what
part identifies the file being modified, what part is redo information,
and what part is undo information.
<p>After the log message is written, the application may issue the write
system call.  After all requests are issued, the application may call
<a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">DB_TXN-&gt;commit</a>.  When <a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">DB_TXN-&gt;commit</a> returns, the caller is
guaranteed that all necessary log writes have been written to disk.
<p>At any time, the application may call <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">DB_TXN-&gt;abort</a>, which will
result in restoration of the database to a consistent pretransaction
state.  (The application may specify its own recovery function for this
purpose using the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_tx_recover.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_tx_recover</a> function.  The recovery function
must be able to either reapply or undo the update depending on the
context, for each different type of log record.)
<p>If the application crashes, the recovery process uses the log to restore
the database to a consistent state.
<p>The <a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html">DB_TXN-&gt;prepare</a> function provides the core functionality to
implement distributed transactions, but it does not manage the
notification of distributed transaction managers.  The caller is
responsible for issuing <a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html">DB_TXN-&gt;prepare</a> calls to all sites
participating in the transaction.  If all responses are positive, the
caller can issue a <a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">DB_TXN-&gt;commit</a>.  If any of the responses are
negative, the caller should issue a <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">DB_TXN-&gt;abort</a>.  In general, the
<a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html">DB_TXN-&gt;prepare</a> call requires that the transaction log be flushed to
disk.
