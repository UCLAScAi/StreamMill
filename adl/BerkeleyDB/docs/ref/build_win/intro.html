<h1 align=center>Building for Win32</h1>
<p>The build_win32 directory in the Berkeley DB distribution contains project files
for both MSVC 5.0 and 6.0:
<p><table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Project File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>    <td align=center>Berkeley_DB.dsw</td>    <td align=center>Visual C++ 5.0 project (compatible with 6.0)</td>    </tr>
<tr>    <td align=center>*.dsp</td>    <td align=center>Visual C++ 5.0 subprojects (compatible with 6.0
)</td>    </tr>
</table>
<p>These project files can be used to build Berkeley DB for any Win32 platform:
Windows/XP, Windows/2000, Windows/NT, Windows/98 and Windows/95.
<h3>Building With Visual C++ 6.0</h3>
<p>Open the file <b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>. You will be told that the project
was generated by a previous version of Developer Studio, and asked if you
want to convert the project. Select Yes, and all projects will be
converted.  Then, continue with the instructions for building with
Visual C++ 5.0.
<p>Note that when you build a release version, you may receive a warning
about an unknown compiler option <i>/Ob2</i>.  This is apparently a
flaw in the project conversion for Visual C++ and can be ignored.
<p>Each release of Berkeley DB is built and tested with this procedure using
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, Standard Edition.
<h3>Building With Visual C++ 5.0</h3>
<p>Open the file <b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>.  This workspace includes a number
of subprojects needed to build Berkeley DB.
<p>First, you'll need to set the include directories.  To do this, select
<i>Options...</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull-down menu. At this
point, a tabbed dialog should appear.  In this new window, choose the
<i>Directories</i> tab. For the <i>Platform</i>, select
<i>Win32</i> and for <i>Show directories for</i>, select
<i>Include files</i>.  Below these options, you should add two
directories to the list of directories: the full pathname of the
<i>build_win32</i> subdirectory of Berkeley DB, followed by the full
pathname of the <i>include</i> subdirectory of Berkeley DB. Then click
OK.
<p>Then, select <i>Active Project Configuration</i> under the
<i>Build</i> pull-down menu.  For a debug version of the libraries,
tools, and examples, select <i>db_buildall -- Win32 Debug</i>.
Results from this build are put into <b>build_win32/Debug</b>.
For a release version, select <i>db_buildall -- Win32 Release</i>;
results are put into <b>build_win32/Release</b>.
For a debug version that has all tools and examples built with
static libraries, select <i>db_buildall -- Win32 Debug Static</i>;
results are put into <b>build_win32/Debug_static</b>.
For a release version of the same,
select <i>db_buildall -- Win32 Release Static</i>;
results are put into <b>build_win32/Release_static</b>.
Finally, to build, select <i>Build db_buildall.exe</i> under the
<i>Build</i> pull-down menu.
<p>When building your application, you should normally use compile options
"debug multithreaded dll" and link against
<b>build_win32/Debug/libdb40d.lib</b>.  If you want
to link against a static (non-DLL) version of the library, use the
"debug multithreaded" compile options and link against
<b>build_win32/Debug_static/libdb40sd.lib</b>.  You can
also build using a release version of the libraries and tools, which will be
placed in <b>build_win32/Release/libdb40.lib</b>.
The static version will be in
<b>build_win32/Release_static/libdb40s.lib</b>.
<p>Each release of Berkeley DB is built and tested using Microsoft Visual C++
5.0 and 6.0.
<h3>Including the C++ API</h3>
<p>C++ support is built automatically on Win32.
<h3>Including the Java API</h3>
<p>Java support is not built automatically.  The following instructions
assume that you have installed the Sun Java Development Kit in
<b>d:/java</b>.  Of course, if you installed elsewhere or have
different Java software, you will need to adjust the pathnames
accordingly.  First, use the previous instructions for Visual C++ 5.0
or 6.0 to open the Tools/Options tabbed dialog for adding include
directories.  In addition to the directories specified previously, add
<b>d:/java/include</b> and <b>d:/java/include/win32</b>.  These are
the directories needed when including <b>jni.h</b>.  Now, before
clicking OK, choose <i>Executable files</i> under <i>Show
directories for</i>.  Add <b>d:/java/bin</b>.  That directory is needed
to find javac.  Now select OK.
<p>Select <i>Active Project Configuration</i> under the
<i>Build</i> pull-down menu.  Choose <i>db_java -- Win32
Release</i>. To build, select <i>Build
libdb_java40.dll</i> under the <i>Build</i> pull-down
menu.  This builds the Java support library for Berkeley DB and compiles all
the java files, placing the resulting
<b>db.jar</b> and <b>dbexamples.jar</b> files
in the <b>build_win32/Release</b> subdirectory of Berkeley DB.
Set your environment variable <b>CLASSPATH</b> to
include the full pathname of these jar files,
and your environment variable <b>PATH</b> to include the
<b>build_win32/Release</b> subdirectory.  On Windows,
remember that files or directories
in the <b>CLASSPATH</b> and <b>PATH</b>
variables must be separated by semicolons (unlike UNIX).
Then, try running the following command as a test:
<p><blockquote><pre>java com.sleepycat.examples.AccessExample</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Including the Tcl API</h3>
<p>Tcl support is not built automatically.  See
<a href="../../ref/tcl/intro.html">Loading Berkeley DB with Tcl</a> for information
on sites from which you can download Tcl and which Tcl versions are
compatible with Berkeley DB.
<p>The Tcl library must be built as the same build type as the Berkeley DB
library (both Release or both Debug).  We found that the binary release
of Tcl can be used with the Release configuration of Berkeley DB, but you will
need to need to build Tcl from sources for the Debug configuration.
Before building Tcl, you will need to modify its makefile to make sure
that you are building a debug version, including thread support.  This
is because the set of DLLs linked into the Tcl executable must match
the corresponding set of DLLs used by Berkeley DB.
<p>These notes assume that Tcl is installed as <b>d:/tcl</b>, but you can
change that if you want.  If you run using a version of Tcl different
from the one currently being used by Sleepycat Software, you will need
to change the name of the Tcl library used in the build (for example,
<b>tcl83d.lib</b>) to the appropriate name.  See
Projects-&gt;Settings-&gt;Link in the db_tcl subproject.
<p>Use the previous instructions for Visual C++ 5.0 or 6.0 to open the
<i>Tools/Options</i> tabbed dialog for adding include directories.
In addition to the directories specified previously, add
<b>d:/tcl/include</b>.  This is the directory that contains
<b>tcl.h</b>.  Then, in that same dialog, show directories for
"Library Files".  Add <b>d:/tcl/lib</b> (or whatever directory
contains <b>tcl83d.lib</b> in your distribution) to the list.  Now,
select OK.
<p>Select <i>Active Project Configuration</i> under the
<i>Build</i> pull-down menu.  Choose <i>db_tcl -- Win32
Release</i>. To build, select <i>Build
libdb_tcl40.dll</i> under the <i>Build</i> pull-down
menu.  This builds the Tcl support library for Berkeley DB, placing the result
into <b>build_win32/Release/libdb_tcl40.dll</b>.
Selecting an Active Configuration of <i>db_tcl -- Win32 Debug</i>
will build a debug version, placing the result into
<b>build_win32/Debug/libdb_tcl40d.dll</b>.
