<h1 align=center>Error returns to applications</h1>
<p>Except for the historic <a href="../../api_c/dbm.html">dbm</a>, <a href="../../api_c/dbm.html">ndbm</a>, and <a href="../../api_c/hsearch.html">hsearch</a>
interfaces, Berkeley DB does not use the global variable <b>errno</b> to
return error values.  The return values for all Berkeley DB functions are
grouped into the following three categories:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>0<dd>A return value of 0 indicates that the operation was successful.
<p><dt>&gt; 0<dd>A return value that is greater than 0 indicates that there was a system
error.  The <b>errno</b> value returned by the system is returned by
the function; for example, when a Berkeley DB function is unable to allocate
memory, the return value from the function will be ENOMEM.
<p><dt>&lt; 0<dd>A return value that is less than 0 indicates a condition that was not
a system failure, but was not an unqualified success, either.  For
example, a routine to retrieve a key/data pair from the database may
return DB_NOTFOUND when the key/data pair does not appear in
the database; as opposed to the value of 0, which would be returned if
the key/data pair were found in the database.
<p><a name="3"><!--meow--></a>
All values returned by Berkeley DB functions are less than 0 in order to avoid
conflict with possible values of <b>errno</b>.  Specifically, Berkeley DB
reserves all values from -30,800 to -30,999 to itself as possible error
values.  There are a few Berkeley DB interfaces where it is possible for an
application function to be called by a Berkeley DB function and subsequently
fail with an application-specific return.  Such failure returns will be
passed back to the function that originally called a Berkeley DB interface.
To avoid ambiguity about the cause of the error, error values separate
from the Berkeley DB error name space should be used.
</dl>
<p>Although possible error returns are specified by each individual function's
manual page, there are a few error returns that deserve general mention:
<h3><a name="DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a> and <a name="DB_KEYEMPTY">DB_KEYEMPTY</a></h3>
<p>There are two special return values that are similar in meaning and that
are returned in similar situations, and therefore might be confused:
DB_NOTFOUND and DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>The DB_NOTFOUND error return indicates that the requested key/data
pair did not exist in the database or that start-of- or end-of-file has
been reached by a cursor.
<p>The DB_KEYEMPTY error return indicates that the requested
key/data pair logically exists but was never explicitly created by the
application (the Recno and Queue access methods will automatically
create key/data pairs under some circumstances; see <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a>
for more information), or that the requested key/data pair was deleted
and never re-created.  In addition, the Queue access method will return
DB_KEYEMPTY for records that were created as part of a
transaction that was later aborted and never re-created.
<h3><a name="DB_KEYEXIST">DB_KEYEXIST</a></h3>
<p>The DB_KEYEXIST error return indicates the <a href="../../api_c/db_put.html#DB_NOOVERWRITE">DB_NOOVERWRITE</a>
option was specified to the <a href="../../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> function and the key already exists
in the database.
<h3><a name="DB_INCOMPLETE">DB_INCOMPLETE</a></h3>
<p>When a database cannot be flushed to disk by <a href="../../api_c/db_close.html">DB-&gt;close</a> or
<a href="../../api_c/db_sync.html">DB-&gt;sync</a>, or by the underlying Memory Pool subsystem methods,
<a href="../../api_c/memp_fsync.html">DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;sync</a> and <a href="../../api_c/memp_sync.html">DB_ENV-&gt;memp_sync</a>, DB_INCOMPLETE may be
returned to the application.
<p>In the case of <a href="../../api_c/db_close.html">DB-&gt;close</a> and <a href="../../api_c/db_sync.html">DB-&gt;sync</a>, the only reason
for a return of DB_INCOMPLETE is if another thread of control
was writing pages in the underlying database file at the same time as
the <a href="../../api_c/db_close.html">DB-&gt;close</a> or <a href="../../api_c/db_sync.html">DB-&gt;sync</a> call was made. For this
reason, a return of DB_INCOMPLETE can normally be ignored; or,
in cases where it is a possible return value, <a href="../../api_c/db_sync.html">DB-&gt;sync</a> should
probably never have been called, or the <a href="../../api_c/db_close.html#DB_NOSYNC">DB_NOSYNC</a> option should
have been specified to <a href="../../api_c/db_close.html">DB-&gt;close</a>.
<p>In the case of <a href="../../api_c/memp_fsync.html">DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;sync</a> or <a href="../../api_c/memp_sync.html">DB_ENV-&gt;memp_sync</a> (or other Berkeley DB
interfaces that call those functions, <a href="../../api_c/txn_checkpoint.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint</a> for
example), a return of DB_INCOMPLETE indicates that the database
environment is under heavy load and the checkpoint was unable to
complete because there were pages that could not be written at this
time.  This is not a fatal error, and the call should be retried.

<h3><a name="DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a></h3>
<p>When multiple threads of control are modifying the database, there is
normally the potential for deadlock. In Berkeley DB, deadlock is signified by
an error return from the Berkeley DB function of the value
DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK.  Whenever a Berkeley DB function returns
DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK, the enclosing transaction should be aborted.
<p>Any Berkeley DB function that attempts to acquire locks can potentially return
DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK.  Practically speaking, the safest way to deal
with applications that can deadlock is to handle a
DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK return from any Berkeley DB access method call.
<h3><a name="DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED">DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED</a></h3>
<p>When multiple threads of control are modifying the database, there is
normally the potential for deadlock.  In order to avoid deadlock,
applications may specify -- on a per-transaction basis -- that if a lock
is unavailable, the Berkeley DB operation should return immediately instead
of waiting on the lock.  The error return in this case will be
DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED.  Whenever a Berkeley DB function returns
DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED, the enclosing transaction should be
aborted.
<h3><a name="DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a></h3>
<p>There exists a class of errors that Berkeley DB considers fatal to an entire
Berkeley DB environment.  An example of this type of error is a corrupted
database or a log write failure because the disk is out of free space.
The only way to recover from these failures is to have all threads of
control exit the Berkeley DB environment, run recovery of the environment, and
re-enter Berkeley DB. (It is not strictly necessary that the processes exit,
although that is the only way to recover system resources, such as file
descriptors and memory, allocated by Berkeley DB.)
<p>When this type of error is encountered, the error value
DB_RUNRECOVERY is returned. This error can be returned by any
Berkeley DB interface.  Once DB_RUNRECOVERY is returned by any
interface, it will be returned from all subsequent Berkeley DB calls made by
any threads of control participating in the environment.
<p>Optionally, applications may also specify a fatal-error callback function
using the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_paniccall.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_paniccall</a> function.  This callback function will be
called with two arguments: a reference to the <a href="../../api_c/env_create.html">DB_ENV</a> structure
associated with the environment and the <b>errno</b> value
associated with the underlying error that caused the problem.
<p>Applications can handle such fatal errors in one of two ways: by checking
for DB_RUNRECOVERY as part of their normal Berkeley DB error return
checking, similarly to DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK or any other error, or
by simply exiting the application when the callback function is called
in applications that have no cleanup processing of their own.
