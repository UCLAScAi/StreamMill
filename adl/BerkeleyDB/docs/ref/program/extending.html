<h1 align=center>Application-specific logging and recovery</h1>
<p>Berkeley DB includes tools to assist in the development of application-specific
logging and recovery.  Specifically, given a description of the
information to be logged, these tools will automatically create logging
functions (functions that take the values as parameters and construct a
single record that is written to the log), read functions (functions that
read a log record and unmarshall the values into a structure that maps
onto the values you chose to log), a print function (for debugging),
templates for the recovery functions, and automatic dispatching to your
recovery functions.
<h3>Defining Application-Specific Operations</h3>
<p>Log records are described in files named XXX.src, where "XXX" is a
unique prefix.  The prefixes currently used in the Berkeley DB package are
btree, crdel, db, hash, log, qam, and txn.  These files contain
interface definition language descriptions for each type of log record
that is supported.
<p>All lines beginning with a hash character in <b>.src</b> files are
treated as comments.
<p>The first non-comment line in the file should begin with the keyword
PREFIX, followed by a string that will be prepended to every function.
Frequently, the PREFIX is either identical or similar to the name of
the <b>.src</b> file.
<p>The rest of the file consists of one or more log record descriptions.
Each log record description begins with the line:
<p><blockquote><pre>BEGIN RECORD_NAME RECORD_NUMBER</pre></blockquote>
<p>and ends with the line:
<p><blockquote><pre>END</pre></blockquote>
<p>The RECORD_NAME variable should be replaced with a unique record name
for this log record.  Record names must be unique within <b>.src</b>
files.
<p>The RECORD_NUMBER variable should be replaced with a record number.
Record numbers must be unique for an entire application; that is, both
application-specific and Berkeley DB log records must have unique values.
Further, because record numbers are stored in log files, which often
must be portable across application releases, no record number should
ever be reused.  The record number space below 10,000 is reserved for
Berkeley DB itself; applications should choose record number values equal to
or greater than 10,000.
<p>Between the BEGIN and END keywords there should be one line for each
data item that will be logged in this log record.  The format of these
lines is as follows:
<p><blockquote><pre>ARG | DBT | POINTER	variable_name	variable_type	printf_format</pre></blockquote>
<p>The keyword ARG indicates that the argument is a simple parameter of
the type specified.  The keyword DBT indicates that the argument is a
DBT containing a length and pointer to a byte string.  The keyword PTR
indicates that the argument is a pointer to the data type specified,
and the entire type should be logged.
<p>The variable name is the field name within the structure that will be
used to refer to this item.  The variable type is the C type of the
variable, and the printf format should be "s" for string, "d" for signed
integral type, or "u" for unsigned integral type.
<h3>Automatically Generated Functions</h3>
<p>The .src file is processed using the gen_rec.awk script in the dist
directory.  This is an awk script that is executed from the dist
directory with the following command line:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f gen_rec.awk \
	-v subsystem = PREFIX \
	-v source_file= C_FILE \
	-v header_file = H_FILE \
	-v template_file = TMP_FILE &lt; XXX.src</pre></blockquote>
<p>where PREFIX is the name specified in the PREFIX line in the .src file,
C_FILE is the name of the file into which to place the automatically
generated C code, H_FILE is the name of the file into which to place
the automatically generated data structures and declarations, and
TMP_FILE is the name of the file into which to place a template for the
recovery routines.
<p>For example, in building the Berkeley DB logging and recovery routines for
hash, the following command line is used:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f gen_rec.awk \
	-v subsystem = hash \
	-v source_file= ../hash/hash_auto.c \
	-v header_file = ../include_auto/hash_auto.h \
	-v template_file = template/rec_hash &lt; hash.src</pre></blockquote>
<p>For each log record description found in the .src file, the following
structure declarations and #defines will be created in the file
header_file:
<p><blockquote><pre>#define DB_PREFIX_RECORD_TYPE        /* Integer ID number */
<p>
typedef struct _PREFIX_RECORD_TYPE_args {
    /*
     * These three fields are generated for every record.
     */
    u_int32_t type;      /* Record type used for dispatch. */
<p>
    /*
     * Transaction handle that identifies the transaction on whose
     * behalf the record is being logged.
     */
    DB_TXN *txnid;
<p>
    /*
     * The log sequence number returned by the previous call to log_put
     * for this transaction.
     */
    DB_LSN *prev_lsn;
<p>
    /*
     * The rest of the structure contains one field for each of
     * the entries in the record statement.
     */
};</pre></blockquote>
<p>The template_file will contain a template for a recovery function.
The recovery function is called on each record read from the log during
system recovery or transaction abort and is expected to redo or undo the
operations described by that record.  The details of the recovery
function will be specific to the record being logged and need to be
written manually, but the template provides a good starting point.
The template file should be copied to a source file in the application
(but not the automatically generated source_file, as that will get
overwritten each time gen_rec.awk is run) and fully developed there.
The recovery function takes the following parameters:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>dbenv<dd>The environment in which recovery is running.
<p><dt>rec<dd>The record being recovered.
<p><dt>lsn<dd>The log sequence number of the record being recovered.
<p><dt>op<dd>A parameter of type db_recops, which indicates what operation is being
run (DB_TXN_ABORT, DB_TXN_APPLY, DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL, DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL).
<p><dt>info<dd>A structure passed by the dispatch function.  It is used to contain a
list of committed transactions and information about files that may have
been deleted.
</dl>
<p>In addition to the header_file and template_file, a source_file is created,
containing a
log, read, recovery, print and getpgnos function for each record type.
<p>The log function marshalls the parameters into a buffer, and calls
<a href="../../api_c/log_put.html">DB_ENV-&gt;log_put</a> on that buffer returning 0 on success and non-zero on
failure.  The log function takes the following parameters:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>dbenv<dd>The environment in which recovery is running.
<p><dt>txnid<dd>The transaction identifier for the transaction handle returned by
<a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_begin</a>.
<p><dt>lsnp<dd>A pointer to storage for a log sequence number into which the log
sequence number of the new log record will be returned.
<p><dt>syncflag<dd>A flag indicating whether the record must be written synchronously.
Valid values are 0 and <a href="../../api_c/log_put.html#DB_FLUSH">DB_FLUSH</a>.
<p><dt>args<dd>The remaining parameters to the log message are the fields described
in the XXX.src file, in order.
</dl>
<p>The read function takes a buffer and unmarshalls its contents into a
structure of the appropriate type.  It returns 0 on success and non-zero
on error.  After the fields of the structure have been used, the pointer
returned from the read function should be freed.  The read function
takes the following parameters:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>dbenv<dd>The environment in which recovery is running.
<p><dt>recbuf<dd>A buffer.
<p><dt>argp<dd>A pointer to a structure of the appropriate type.
</dl>
<p>The print function displays the contents of the record.  The print
function takes the same parameters as the recovery function described
previously.  Although some of the parameters are unused by the print
function, taking the same parameters  allows a single dispatch loop to
dispatch to a variety of functions.  The print function takes the
following parameters:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>dbenv<dd>The environment in which recovery is running.
<p><dt>rec<dd>The record being recovered.
<p><dt>lsn<dd>The log sequence number of the record being recovered.
<p><dt>op<dd>Unused.
<p><dt>info<dd>Unused.
</dl>
<p>The getpgnos function processes a log record and returns the set of
pages accessed by the record.  This function will not need to do
anything for most application-specific log records.  The getpgnos
function takes the same parameters as the recovery function described
previously.  Although some of the parameters are unused by the getpgnos
function, taking the same parameters  allows a single dispatch loop to
dispatch to a variety of functions.  The getpgnos function takes the
following parameters:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>dbenv<dd>The environment in which recovery is running.
<p><dt>rec<dd>The record being recovered.
<p><dt>lsn<dd>The log sequence number of the record being recovered.
<p><dt>op<dd>Unused.
<p><dt>info<dd>This should be a pointer to a TXN_RECS structure that is filled out
with the page numbers identified in the record.
</dl>
<p>Three additional functions are also created for each <b>.src</b> file.
The are initialization functions for each of the print routines, the
getpgnos routines and the recovery routines.  All three initialization
functions take a single parameter:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>dbenv<dd>The environment in which recovery is running.
</dl>
<p>The print initialization function registers the print routines for each
log record type declared with the dispatch system, so the appropriate
function is called from the dispatch loop.
<p>The getpgnos initialization function registers the getpgno routines for
each log record type declared with the dispatch system, so the
appropriate function is called from the dispatch loop.
<p>The recovery initialization function registers the recovery routines
for each log record type declared with the dispatch system, so the
appropriate function is called from the dispatch loop.
<h3>Using Automatically Generated Routines</h3>
<p>Applications use the automatically generated functions, as follows:
<p><ol>
<p><li>When the application starts, call the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_rec_init.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_recovery_init</a>
with your recovery initialization function so that the initialization
function is called at the appropriate time.  To use the
<a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility or the <a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> utility, you will
need to modify them to call your initialization routine as well as all
the standard Berkeley DB initialization routines.
<p><li>Issue a <a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_begin</a> call before any operations you want to be
transaction-protected.
<p><li>Before accessing any data, issue the appropriate lock call to lock the
data (either for reading or writing).
<p><li>Before modifying any data that is transaction-protected, issue a call
to the appropriate log function.
<p><li>Call <a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">DB_TXN-&gt;commit</a> to save all the changes, or call <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">DB_TXN-&gt;abort</a>
to cancel all of the modifications.
</ol>
<p>The recovery functions are called in the three following cases:
<p><ol>
<p><li>From the recovery daemon upon system failure, with op set to
DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL or DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL.
<p><li>From <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">DB_TXN-&gt;abort</a> if it is called to abort a transaction, with op
set to DB_TXN_ABORT.
<p><li>On a replicated client to apply updates from the master, with op set to
DB_TXN_APPLY.
</ol>
<p>For each log record type you declare, you must write the appropriate
function to undo and redo the modifications.  The shell of these
functions will be generated for you automatically, but you must fill in
the details.
<p>Your code must be able to detect whether the described modifications
have been applied to the data.  The function will be called with the
"op" parameter set to DB_TXN_ABORT when a transaction that wrote the
log record aborts, with DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL and DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL
during recovery, and with DB_TXN_APPLY on a replicated client.  The
actions for DB_TXN_ABORT and DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL should generally be
the same and the actions for DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL and DB_TXN_APPLY should
generally be the same.
<p>For example each access method database page contains the log sequence
number of the most recent log record that describes a modification to
the page.  When the access method changes a page, it writes a log record
describing the change and including the log sequence number (LSN) that
was on the page before the change.  This LSN is referred to as the
previous LSN.  The recovery functions read the page described by a log
record, and compare the LSN on the page to the LSN they were passed.
If the page LSN is less than the passed LSN and the operation is an
undo, no action is necessary (because the modifications have not been
written to the page).  If the page LSN is the same as the previous LSN
and the operation is a redo, the actions described are reapplied to the
page.  If the page LSN is equal to the passed LSN and the operation is
an undo, the actions are removed from the page; if the page LSN is
greater than the passed LSN and the operation is a redo, no further
action is necessary.  If the action is a redo and the LSN on the page
is less than the previous LSN in the log record, it is an error because
it could happen only if some previous log record was not processed.
<p>Please refer to the internal recovery functions in the Berkeley DB library
(found in files named XXX_rec.c) for examples of the way recovery
functions should work.
<h3>Non-conformant Logging</h3>
<p>If your application cannot conform to the default logging and recovery
structure, you will have to create your own logging and recovery
functions explicitly.
<p>If you do not use the default recovery system, you need to construct
your own recovery process based on the recovery program provided in
db_recover/db_recover.c.  Note that your recovery functions need to
correctly process the log records produced by calls to <a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_begin</a>
and <a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">DB_TXN-&gt;commit</a>.
